            How to Set Books Free on Amazon:
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            JTB staff will be checking that all participating authors&apos; books are
            set free at 12am PST on the first day of the event. If your book is
            not free during this time, you will be removed from the website as
            we do not want to mislead any readers. If you are experiencing any
            difficulty in setting your book free, don&apos;t hesitate to send a
            message in <Link href="https://discord.gg/SWVQ36VVjA">Discord</Link>, and one of the other participating authors or
            the JTB staff can help guide you through the process.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            There are 2 ways to set your books to be free on Amazon.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            <strong>Option 1:</strong> If you are enrolled in KDP Select,
            Amazon has directions you can find here. KDP Select has enrollment
            periods of 90 days. The maximum number of free book days during each
            enrollment period is <strong>FIVE</strong>. If you have already used
            your free days during the time in which this event is being held,
            you will NOT be able to set your book free via this method. If your
            enrollment end date falls on one of the days between February 1st
            and February 3rd, you will also not be able to use this method to
            set your books free.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            <strong>Option 2:</strong> To set your book free without being
            enrolled in KDP Select, you MUST set your ebook free on all
            available vendors first and reach out to Amazon via email through
            their customer service portal <Link href='https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G201298240'>here</Link>. This email should contain links
            to where else your book is available to buy to prove your ebook is
            free elsewhere. In the dropdown, select ‚ÄúPricing‚Äù then ‚ÄúPrice
            Matching‚Äù and request a price match. This should be done a week
            prior to the event to give Amazon ample time to make the price
            adjustment. Please note that Amazon is not obligated to change the
            price. If they deny the request, you can attempt again by sending
            more links and proof that your book is free on other sites. This
            method is much more complicated than the first.
